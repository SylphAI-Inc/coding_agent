## Overview

OpenHands (formerly OpenDevin) is the leading open-source platform for cloud coding agents. Its **Software Agent SDK** is a composable Python library providing sandboxed execution, multi-agent orchestration, and code-aware tooling — designed for agents that autonomously write and ship code.

## Key Features

- **Sandboxed execution** — Docker-based runtime sandboxes for safe code execution
- **Agent architecture** — Pluggable agent implementations (CodeAct, browsing, planning)
- **Multi-agent** — Delegate subtasks to specialized agents
- **Model-agnostic** — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, local models via LiteLLM
- **Observation-action loop** — Structured event stream for agent decision-making
- **SWE-bench validated** — Top scores on autonomous issue fixing benchmarks

## When to Use

✅ Building a cloud-hosted coding agent
✅ Need sandboxed code execution
✅ Want to deploy agents as a service

❌ Lightweight terminal-based agent (use AdalFlow or Aider)
