## Overview

SWE-agent is a research framework from Princeton NLP that enables LLMs to autonomously fix real GitHub issues. It achieved the first open-source SOTA on SWE-bench by providing LLMs with a custom **Agent-Computer Interface (ACI)** — specialized commands for navigating, searching, and editing codebases.

## Key Features

- **Agent-Computer Interface (ACI)** — Custom shell commands optimized for LLM code editing
- **SWE-bench SOTA** — Proven on real-world GitHub issues at scale
- **Configurable agents** — YAML-based agent configuration
- **Multi-model** — Works with GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet, and other models
- **Docker sandboxing** — Safe execution environment for each issue

## When to Use

✅ Autonomous GitHub issue fixing
✅ SWE-bench evaluation and research
✅ Building agents that work on unfamiliar codebases

❌ Interactive development (use AdaL CLI or Aider)
