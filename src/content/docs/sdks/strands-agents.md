## Overview

Strands Agents is an open-source agent framework from AWS for building model-driven AI agents with Python and TypeScript. It uses a simple agent loop — model, tools, and prompt — where the model dynamically plans, selects tools, and orchestrates steps to complete tasks.

## Key Features

- **Model-driven orchestration** — The model plans, selects tools, and reflects on results
- **Provider-agnostic** — Amazon Bedrock, OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, LiteLLM, and custom providers
- **MCP support** — Native Model Context Protocol integration for external tools
- **Multi-agent** — Primitives for handoffs, swarms, and graph workflows
- **Python & TypeScript** — SDKs for both languages

## When to Use

✅ Model-driven agents with minimal framework code
✅ Need multi-provider model support
✅ Building multi-agent systems with handoffs
✅ AWS and Bedrock ecosystem
